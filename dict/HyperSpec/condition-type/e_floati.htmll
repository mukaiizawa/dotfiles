CLHS: Condition Type FLOATING-POINT-INVALID-OPERATION
Condition Type FLOATING-POINT-INVALID-OPERATION 
Class Precedence List:
 floating-point-invalid-operation, arithmetic-error, error, serious-condition, condition, t 
Description:
The type floating-point-invalid-operation consists of error conditions that occur because of certain floating point traps. 
It is implementation-dependent whether floating point traps occur, and whether or how they may be enabled or disabled. Therefore, conforming code may establish handlers for this condition, but must not depend on its being signaled. 
The following X3J13 cleanup issue, not part of the specification, applies to this section: FLOATING-POINT-CONDITION-NAMES:X3J13-NOV-89
