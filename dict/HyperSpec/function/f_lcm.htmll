CLHS: Function LCM
Function LCM 
Syntax:
lcm &rest integers => least-common-multiple
Arguments and Values:
integer---an integer. 
least-common-multiple---a non-negative integer. 
Description:
lcm returns the least common multiple of the integers. 
 If no integer is supplied, the integer 1 is returned.  
If only one integer is supplied, the absolute value of that integer is returned. 
For two arguments that are not both zero, 
 (lcm a b) ==  (/ (abs (* a b)) (gcd a b))
If one or both arguments are zero, 
 (lcm a 0) ==  (lcm 0 a) ==  0
For three or more arguments, 
 (lcm a b c ... z) ==  (lcm (lcm a b) c ... z)
Examples:
 (lcm 10) =>  10
 (lcm 25 30) =>  150
 (lcm -24 18 10) =>  360
 (lcm 14 35) =>  70
 (lcm 0 5) =>  0
 (lcm 1 2 3 4 5 6) =>  60
Side Effects: None.
Affected By: None.
Exceptional Situations:
Should signal type-error if any argument is not an integer.
