CLHS: Function SPECIAL-OPERATOR-P
Function SPECIAL-OPERATOR-P 
Syntax:
special-operator-p symbol => generalized-boolean
Arguments and Values:
symbol---a symbol. 
generalized-boolean---a generalized boolean. 
Description:
Returns true if symbol is a special operator; otherwise, returns false. 
Examples:
 (special-operator-p 'if) =>  true
 (special-operator-p 'car) =>  false
 (special-operator-p 'one) =>  false
Side Effects: None.
Affected By: None.
Exceptional Situations:

Notes:
Historically, this function was called special-form-p. The name was finally declared a misnomer and changed, since it returned true for special operators, not special forms. 
The following X3J13 cleanup issue, not part of the specification, applies to this section: SPECIAL-FORM-P-MISNOMER:RENAME
