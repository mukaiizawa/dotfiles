CLHS: Function DIRECTORY
Function DIRECTORY 
Syntax:
directory pathspec &key => pathnames
Arguments and Values:
 pathspec---a pathname designator, which may contain wild components.  
pathnames---a list of  physical pathnames.  
Description:
Determines which, if any, files that are present in the file system have names matching pathspec, and returns a  fresh  list of pathnames corresponding to the truenames of those files. 
An implementation may be extended to accept implementation-defined keyword arguments to directory. 
Examples: None.
Affected By:
The host computer's file system. 
Exceptional Situations:
 If the attempt to obtain a directory listing is not successful, an error of type file-error is signaled.  
See Also:
pathname,  logical-pathname,  ensure-directories-exist, Section 20.1 (File System Concepts), Section 20.1.2 (File Operations on Open and Closed Streams),  Section 19.1.2 (Pathnames as Filenames)  
Notes:
If the pathspec is not wild, the resulting list will contain either zero or one elements. 
Common Lisp specifies ``&key'' in the argument list to directory even though no standardized keyword arguments to directory are defined. ``:allow-other-keys t'' may be used in conforming programs in order to quietly ignore any additional keywords which are passed by the program but not supported by the implementation.
