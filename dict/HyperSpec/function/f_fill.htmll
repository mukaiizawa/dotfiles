CLHS: Function FILL
Function FILL 
Syntax:
fill sequence item &key start end => sequence
Arguments and Values:
sequence---a proper sequence. 
item---a sequence. 
  start, end---bounding index designators of sequence. The defaults for start and end are 0 and nil, respectively.   
Description:
Replaces the elements of sequence bounded by start and end with item. 
Examples:
 (fill (list 0 1 2 3 4 5) '(444)) =>  ((444) (444) (444) (444) (444) (444))
 (fill (copy-seq '01234') #e :start 3) =>  '012ee'
 (setq x (vector 'a 'b 'c 'd 'e)) =>  #(A B C D E)
 (fill x 'z :start 1 :end 3) =>  #(A Z Z D E)
 x =>  #(A Z Z D E)
 (fill x 'p) =>  #(P P P P P)
 x =>  #(P P P P P)
Side Effects:
Sequence is destructively modified. 
Affected By: None.
Exceptional Situations:
Should be prepared to signal an error of type type-error if sequence is not a proper sequence. Should signal an error of type type-error if start is not a non-negative integer. Should signal an error of type type-error if end is not a non-negative integer or nil.

(fill sequence item) == (nsubstitute-if item (constantly t) sequence)
