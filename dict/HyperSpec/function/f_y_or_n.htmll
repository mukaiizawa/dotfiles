CLHS: Function Y-OR-N-P, YES-OR-NO-P
Function Y-OR-N-P, YES-OR-NO-P 
Syntax:
y-or-n-p &optional control &rest arguments => generalized-boolean
yes-or-no-p &optional control &rest arguments => generalized-boolean
Arguments and Values:
 control---a format control.  
arguments---format arguments for control. 
generalized-boolean---a generalized boolean. 
Description:
These functions ask a question and parse a response from the user. They return true if the answer is affirmative, or false if the answer is negative. 
y-or-n-p is for asking the user a question whose answer is either ``yes'' or ``no.'' It is intended that the reply require the user to answer a yes-or-no question with a single character. yes-or-no-p is also for asking the user a question whose answer is either ``Yes'' or ``No.'' It is intended that the reply require the user to take more action than just a single keystroke, such as typing the full word yes or no followed by a newline. 
y-or-n-p types out a message (if supplied), reads an answer in some implementation-dependent manner (intended to be short and simple, such as reading a single character such as Y or N). yes-or-no-p types out a message (if supplied), attracts the user's attention (for example, by ringing the terminal's bell), and reads an answer in some implementation-dependent manner (intended to be multiple characters, such as YES or NO). 
If format-control is supplied and not nil, then a fresh-line operation is performed; then a message is printed as if format-control and arguments were given to format. In any case, yes-or-no-p and y-or-n-p will provide a prompt such as ``(Y or N)'' or ``(Yes or No)'' if appropriate. 
All input and output are performed using query I/O. 
Examples:
 (y-or-n-p '(t or nil) given by')
>>  (t or nil) given by (Y or N) Y
=>  true
 (yes-or-no-p 'a ~S message' 'frightening) 
>>  a FRIGHTENING message (Yes or No) no
=>  false
 (y-or-n-p 'Produce listing file?') 
>>  Produce listing file?
>>  Please respond with Y or N. n
=>  false
Side Effects:
Output to and input from query I/O will occur. 
Affected By:
*query-io*. 
Exceptional Situations: None.

Notes:
yes-or-no-p and yes-or-no-p do not add question marks to the end of the prompt string, so any desired question mark or other punctuation should be explicitly included in the text query.
