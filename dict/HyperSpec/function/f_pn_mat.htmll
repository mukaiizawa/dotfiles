CLHS: Function PATHNAME-MATCH-P
Function PATHNAME-MATCH-P 
Syntax:
pathname-match-p pathname wildcard => generalized-boolean
Arguments and Values:
 pathname---a pathname designator. 
wildcard---a designator for a wild pathname.  
generalized-boolean---a generalized boolean. 
Description:
pathname-match-p returns true if pathname matches wildcard, otherwise nil. The matching rules are implementation-defined but should be consistent with directory. Missing components of wildcard default to :wild. 
It is valid for pathname to be a wild pathname; a wildcard field in pathname only matches a wildcard field in wildcard (i.e., pathname-match-p is not commutative). It is valid for wildcard to be a non-wild pathname. 
Examples: None.
Affected By: None.
Exceptional Situations:
If pathname or wildcard is not a pathname, string, or stream associated with a file an error of type type-error is signaled.
