Variable *GENSYM-COUNTER*

Value Type:
a non-negative integer.

Initial Value:
implementation-dependent.

Description:
A number which will be used in constructing the name of the next symbol generated by the function gensym.
*gensym-counter* can be either assigned or bound at any time, but its value must always be a non-negative integer.

Affected By:
gensym.

See Also:

Notes:
The ability to pass a numeric argument to gensym has been deprecated; explicitly binding *gensym-counter* is now stylistically preferred.  The following X3J13 cleanup issue, not part of the specification, applies to this section: GENSYM-NAME-STICKINESS:LIKE-TEFLO
