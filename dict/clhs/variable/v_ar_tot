CLHS: Constant Variable ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT
Constant Variable ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT 
Constant Value:
A positive  fixnum,  the exact magnitude of which is implementation-dependent, but which is not less than 1024. 
Description:
The upper exclusive bound on the array total size of an array. 
The actual limit on the array total size imposed by the implementation might vary according the element type of the array; in this case, the value of array-total-size-limit will be the smallest of these possible limits. 
Examples: None.
See Also:
make-array, array-element-type 
Notes: None.
The following X3J13 cleanup issue, not part of the specification, applies to this section: ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT-IMPLICATIONS:ALL-FIXNUM
