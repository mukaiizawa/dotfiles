Constant Variable MULTIPLE-VALUES-LIMIT

Constant Value:
An integer not smaller than 20, the exact magnitude of which is implementation-dependent.

Description:
The upper exclusive bound on the number of values that may be returned from a function,  bound or assigned by multiple-value-bind or multiple-value-setq, or passed as a first argument to nth-value. (If these individual limits might differ, the minimum value is used.)

lambda-parameters-limit, call-arguments-limit

Notes:
Implementors are encouraged to make this limit as large as possible.
