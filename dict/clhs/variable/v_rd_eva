Variable *READ-EVAL*

Value Type:
a generalized boolean.

Initial Value:
true.

Description:
If it is true, the #. reader macro has its normal effect. Otherwise, that reader macro signals an error of type reader-error.

See Also:
*print-readably*

Notes:
If *read-eval* is false and *print-readably* is true, any method for print-object that would output a reference to the #. reader macro either outputs something different or signals an error of type print-not-readable.
