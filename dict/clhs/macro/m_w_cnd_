Macro WITH-CONDITION-RESTARTS 

Syntax:
with-condition-restarts condition-form restarts-form form* => result*

Arguments and Values:
condition-form---a form; evaluated to produce a condition. 
condition---a condition object resulting from the evaluation of condition-form. 
restart-form---a form; evaluated to produce a restart-list. 
restart-list---a list of restart objects resulting from the evaluation of restart-form. 
forms---an implicit progn; evaluated. 
results---the values returned by forms. 

Description:
First, the condition-form and restarts-form are evaluated in normal left-to-right order; the primary values yielded by these evaluations are respectively called the condition and the restart-list. 
Next, the forms are evaluated in a dynamic environment in which each restart in restart-list is associated with the condition. See Section 9.1.4.2.4 (Associating a Restart with a Condition).

Notes:
Usually this macro is not used explicitly in code, since restart-case handles most of the common cases in a way that is syntactically more concise.
