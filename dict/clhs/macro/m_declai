Macro DECLAIM 

Syntax:
declaim declaration-specifier* => implementation-dependent

Arguments and Values:
declaration-specifier---a declaration specifier; not evaluated. 

Description:
Establishes the declarations specified by the declaration-specifiers. 
If a use of this macro appears as a top level form in a file being processed by the file compiler, the proclamations are also made at compile-time. As with other defining macros, it is unspecified whether or not the compile-time side-effects of a declaim persist after the file has been compiled.
