CLHS: Local Macro PPRINT-EXIT-IF-LIST-EXHAUSTED
Local Macro PPRINT-EXIT-IF-LIST-EXHAUSTED 
Syntax:
pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted <no arguments> => nil
Arguments and Values: None.
Description:
Tests whether or not the list passed to the lexically current logical block has been exhausted; see Section 22.2.1.1 (Dynamic Control of the Arrangement of Output). If this list has been reduced to nil, pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted terminates the execution of the lexically current logical block except for the printing of the suffix. Otherwise pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted returns nil. 
 Whether or not pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted is fbound in the global environment is implementation-dependent; however, the restrictions on redefinition and shadowing of pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted are the same as for symbols in the COMMON-LISP package which are fbound in the global environment. The consequences of attempting to use pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted outside of pprint-logical-block are undefined.  
Examples: None.
Side Effects: None.
Affected By: None.
Exceptional Situations:
An error is signaled (at macro expansion time or at run time) if pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted is used anywhere other than lexically within a call on pprint-logical-block. Also, the consequences of executing pprint-if-list-exhausted outside of the dynamic extent of the pprint-logical-block which lexically contains it are undefined. 
See Also:
pprint-logical-block, pprint-pop. 
Notes: None.
