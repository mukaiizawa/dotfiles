CLHS: Macro WITH-OPEN-STREAM
Macro WITH-OPEN-STREAM 
Syntax:
with-open-stream (var stream) declaration* form* => result*
Arguments and Values:
var---a variable name. 
stream---a form; evaluated to produce a stream. 
declaration---a declare expression; not evaluated. 
forms---an implicit progn. 
results---the values returned by the forms. 
Description:
with-open-stream performs a series of operations on stream, returns a value, and then closes the stream. 
Var is bound to the value of stream, and then forms are executed as an implicit progn. stream is automatically closed on exit from with-open-stream, no matter whether the exit is normal or abnormal.  The stream has dynamic extent; its extent ends when the form is exited.  
 The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to assign the the variable var with the forms.  
Examples:
 (with-open-stream (s (make-string-input-stream '1 2 3 4'))
    (+ (read s) (read s) (read s))) =>  6
Side Effects:
The stream is closed (upon exit). 
Affected By: None.
Exceptional Situations: None.
