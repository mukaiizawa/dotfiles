CLHS: Restart MUFFLE-WARNING
Restart MUFFLE-WARNING 
Data Arguments Required:
None. 
Description:
This restart is established by warn so that handlers of warning conditions have a way to tell warn that a warning has already been dealt with and that no further action is warranted. 
Examples:
 (defvar *all-quiet* nil) =>  *ALL-QUIET*
 (defvar *saved-warnings* '()) =>  *SAVED-WARNINGS*
 (defun quiet-warning-handler (c)
   (when *all-quiet*
     (let ((r (find-restart 'muffle-warning c)))
       (when r 
         (push c *saved-warnings*)
         (invoke-restart r)))))
=>  CUSTOM-WARNING-HANDLER
 (defmacro with-quiet-warnings (&body forms)
   `(let ((*all-quiet* t)
          (*saved-warnings* '()))
      (handler-bind ((warning #'quiet-warning-handler))
        ,@forms
        *saved-warnings*)))
=>  WITH-QUIET-WARNINGS
 (setq saved
   (with-quiet-warnings
     (warn 'Situation #1.')
     (let ((*all-quiet* nil))
       (warn 'Situation #2.'))
     (warn 'Situation #3.')))
>>  Warning: Situation #2.
=>  (#<SIMPLE-WARNING 42744421> #<SIMPLE-WARNING 42744365>)
 (dolist (s saved) (format t '~&~A~%' s))
>>  Situation #3.
>>  Situation #1.
=>  NIL
