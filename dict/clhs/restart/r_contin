Restart CONTINUE 

Description:
The continue restart is generally part of protocols where there is a single ``obvious'' way to continue, such as in break and cerror. Some user-defined protocols may also wish to incorporate it for similar reasons. In general, however, it is more reliable to design a special purpose restart with a name that more directly suits the particular application. 

Examples:
 (let ((x 3))
   (handler-bind ((error #'(lambda (c)
                             (let ((r (find-restart 'continue c)))
                               (when r (invoke-restart r))))))
     (cond ((not (floatp x))
            (cerror 'Try floating it.' '~D is not a float.' x)
            (float x))
           (t x)))) =>  3.0
