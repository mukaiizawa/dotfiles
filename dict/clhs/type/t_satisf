Type Specifier SATISFIES 

Compound Type Specifier Kind:
Predicating. 

Compound Type Specifier Syntax:
satisfies predicate-name

Compound Type Specifier Arguments:
predicate-name---a symbol. 

Compound Type Specifier Description:
This denotes the set of all objects that satisfy the predicate predicate-name, which must be a symbol whose global function definition is a one-argument predicate. A name is required for predicate-name; lambda expressions are not allowed. For example, the type specifier (and integer (satisfies evenp)) denotes the set of all even integers. The form (typep x '(satisfies p)) is equivalent to (if (p x) t nil). 
The argument is required. The symbol * can be the argument, but it denotes itself (the symbol *), and does not represent an unspecified value. 
The symbol satisfies is not valid as a type specifier.
