Type COMPILED-FUNCTION

Supertypes:
compiled-function, function, t

Description:
Any function may be considered by an implementation to be a a compiled function if it contains no references to macros that must be expanded at run time, and it contains no unresolved references to load time values. See Section 3.2.2 (Compilation Semantics).
Functions whose definitions appear lexically within a file that has been compiled with compile-file and then loaded with load are of type compiled-function.  Functions produced by the compile function are of type compiled-function.  Other functions might also be of type compiled-function.
