CLHS: System Class INTEGER
System Class INTEGER 
Class Precedence List:
 integer, rational,  real,  number, t 
Description:
An integer is a mathematical integer. There is no limit on the magnitude of an integer. 
 The types fixnum and bignum form an exhaustive partition of type integer.  
 Compound Type Specifier Kind:
Abbreviating. 
Compound Type Specifier Syntax:
integer [lower-limit [upper-limit]]
Compound Type Specifier Arguments:
lower-limit, upper-limit---interval designators for type integer. The defaults for each of lower-limit and upper-limit is the symbol *. 
Compound Type Specifier Description:
This denotes the integers on the interval described by lower-limit and upper-limit.

Notes:
The type (integer lower upper), where lower and upper are most-negative-fixnum and most-positive-fixnum, respectively, is also called fixnum. 
The type (integer 0 1) is also called bit. The type (integer 0 *) is also called unsigned-byte.
