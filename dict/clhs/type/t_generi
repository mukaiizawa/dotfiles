System Class GENERIC-FUNCTION

Class Precedence List:
generic-function, function, t

Description:
A generic function is a function whose behavior depends on the classes or identities of the arguments supplied to it. A generic function object contains a set of methods, a lambda list, a method combination type, and other information. The methods define the class-specific behavior and operations of the generic function; a method is said to specialize a generic function. When invoked, a generic function executes a subset of its methods based on the classes or identities of its arguments.
A generic function can be used in the same ways that an ordinary function can be used; specifically, a generic function can be used as an argument to funcall and apply, and can be given a global or a local name.
