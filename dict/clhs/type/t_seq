CLHS: System Class SEQUENCE
System Class SEQUENCE 
Class Precedence List:
 sequence, t 
Description:
Sequences are ordered collections of objects, called the elements of the sequence. 
The types vector and the type list are disjoint subtypes of type sequence, but are not necessarily an exhaustive partition of sequence. 
When viewing a vector as a sequence, only the active elements of that vector are considered elements of the sequence; that is, sequence operations respect the fill pointer when given sequences represented as vectors.
