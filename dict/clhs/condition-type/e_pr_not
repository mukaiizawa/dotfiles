Condition Type PRINT-NOT-READABLE

Class Precedence List:
print-not-readable, error, serious-condition, condition, t

Description:
The type print-not-readable consists of error conditions that occur during output while *print-readably* is true, as a result of attempting to write a printed representation with the Lisp printer that would not be correctly read back with the Lisp reader. The object which could not be printed is initialized by the :objectinitialization argument to make-condition, and is accessed by the function print-not-readable-object.
