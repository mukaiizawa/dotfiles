CLHS: Function SET-MACRO-CHARACTER, GET-MACRO-CHARACTER
Function SET-MACRO-CHARACTER, GET-MACRO-CHARACTER 
Syntax:
get-macro-character char &optional readtable => function, non-terminating-p
set-macro-character char new-function &optional non-terminating-p readtable => t
Arguments and Values:
char---a character. 
non-terminating-p---a generalized boolean. The default is false. 
 readtable---a readtable designator.  The default is the current readtable. 
function---nil, or a designator for a function of two arguments. 
new-function---a function designator. 
Description:
get-macro-character returns as its primary value, function, the reader macro function associated with char in readtable (if any), or else nil if char is not a macro character in readtable. The secondary value, non-terminating-p, is true if char is a non-terminating macro character; otherwise, it is false. 
set-macro-character causes char to be a macro character associated with the reader macro function new-function (or the designator for new-function) in readtable. If non-terminating-p is true, char becomes a non-terminating macro character; otherwise it becomes a terminating macro character. 
Examples:
 (get-macro-character #{) =>  NIL, false
 (not (get-macro-character #;)) =>  false
The following is a possible definition for the single-quote reader macro in standard syntax: 
 (defun single-quote-reader (stream char)
   (declare (ignore char))
   (list 'quote (read stream t nil t))) =>  SINGLE-QUOTE-READER
 (set-macro-character #' #'single-quote-reader) =>  T
Here single-quote-reader reads an object following the single-quote and returns a list of quote and that object. The char argument is ignored. 
The following is a possible definition for the semicolon reader macro in standard syntax: 
 (defun semicolon-reader (stream char)
   (declare (ignore char))
   ;; First swallow the rest of the current input line.
   ;; End-of-file is acceptable for terminating the comment.
   (do () ((char= (read-char stream nil #Newline t) #Newline)))
   ;; Return zero values.
   (values)) =>  SEMICOLON-READER
 (set-macro-character #; #'semicolon-reader) =>  T
