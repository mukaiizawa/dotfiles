Accessor FILL-POINTER
Syntax:
fill-pointer vector => fill-pointer
(setf (fill-pointer vector) new-fill-pointer)

 (setq a (make-array 8 :fill-pointer 4)) =>  #(NIL NIL NIL NIL)
 (fill-pointer a) =>  4
 (dotimes (i (length a)) (setf (aref a i) (* i i))) =>  NIL
 a =>  #(0 1 4 9)
 (setf (fill-pointer a) 3) =>  3
 (fill-pointer a) =>  3
 a =>  #(0 1 4)
 (setf (fill-pointer a) 8) =>  8
 a =>  #(0 1 4 9 NIL NIL NIL NIL)
