Function LOGTEST 

Syntax:
logtest integer-1 integer-2 => generalized-boolean

Arguments and Values:
integer-1---an integer.
integer-2---an integer.
generalized-boolean---a generalized boolean.

Description:
Returns true if any of the bits designated by the 1's in integer-1 is 1 in integer-2; otherwise it is false. integer-1 and integer-2 are treated as if they were binary.
Negative integer-1 and integer-2 are treated as if they were represented in two's-complement binary.

Examples:
 (logtest 1 7) =>  true
 (logtest 1 2) =>  false
 (logtest -2 -1) =>  true
 (logtest 0 -1) =>  false

Exceptional Situations:
Should signal an error of type type-error if integer-1 is not an integer. Should signal an error of type type-error if integer-2 is not an integer.

Notes:
 (logtest x y) ==  (not (zerop (logand x y)))
