Function SPECIAL-OPERATOR-P

Syntax:
special-operator-p symbol => generalized-boolean

Arguments and Values:
symbol---a symbol.
generalized-boolean---a generalized boolean.

Description:
Returns true if symbol is a special operator; otherwise, returns false.

Examples:
 (special-operator-p 'if) =>  true
 (special-operator-p 'car) =>  false
 (special-operator-p 'one) =>  false

Exceptional Situations:
Should signal type-error if its argument is not a symbol.

Notes:
Historically, this function was called special-form-p. The name was finally declared a misnomer and changed, since it returned true for special operators, not special forms.
