Function DIRECTORY

Syntax:
directory pathspec &key => pathnames

Arguments and Values:
pathspec---a pathname designator, which may contain wild components.
pathnames---a list of  physical pathnames.

Description:
Determines which, if any, files that are present in the file system have names matching pathspec, and returns a  fresh  list of pathnames corresponding to the truenames of those files.
An implementation may be extended to accept implementation-defined keyword arguments to directory.

Affected By:
The host computer's file system.

Exceptional Situations:
If the attempt to obtain a directory listing is not successful, an error of type file-error is signaled.

See Also:
pathname,  logical-pathname,  ensure-directories-exist

Notes:
If the pathspec is not wild, the resulting list will contain either zero or one elements.
Common Lisp specifies ``&key'' in the argument list to directory even though no standardized keyword arguments to directory are defined. ``:allow-other-keys t'' may be used in conforming programs in order to quietly ignore any additional keywords which are passed by the program but not supported by the implementation.
