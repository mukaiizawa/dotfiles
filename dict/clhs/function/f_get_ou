        a-string 'abcdefghijklm') =>  'abcdefghijklm'
 (write-string a-string a-stream) =>  'abcdefghijklm'
 (get-output-stream-string a-stream) =>  'abcdefghijklm'
 (get-output-stream-string a-stream) =>  ''

Side Effects:
The string-output-stream is cleared.

Exceptional Situations:
The consequences are undefined if stream-output-string is closed.
The consequences are undefined if string-output-stream is a stream that was not produced by make-string-output-stream.  The consequences are undefined if string-output-stream was created implicitly by with-output-to-string or format.
