CLHS: Function TERPRI, FRESH-LINE
Function TERPRI, FRESH-LINE 
Syntax:
terpri &optional output-stream => nil
fresh-line &optional output-stream => generalized-boolean
Arguments and Values:
output-stream -- an output stream designator. The default is standard output. 
generalized-boolean---a generalized boolean. 
Description:
terpri outputs a newline to output-stream. 
fresh-line is similar to terpri but outputs a newline only if the output-stream is not already at the start of a line. If for some reason this cannot be determined, then a newline is output anyway. fresh-line returns true if it outputs a newline; otherwise it returns false. 
Examples:
 (with-output-to-string (s)
    (write-string 'some text' s)
    (terpri s)
    (terpri s)
    (write-string 'more text' s))
=>  'some text
more text'
 (with-output-to-string (s)
    (write-string 'some text' s)
    (fresh-line s)
    (fresh-line s)
    (write-string 'more text' s))
=>  'some text
more text'
Side Effects:
The output-stream is modified. 
Affected By:
*standard-output*, *terminal-io*. 
Exceptional Situations:
None.  See Also: None.
Notes:
terpri is identical in effect to 
 (write-char #Newline output-stream)
