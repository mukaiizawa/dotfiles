Function REALPART, IMAGPART

Syntax:
realpart number => real
imagpart number => real

Arguments and Values:
number---a number.
real---a real.

Description:
realpart and imagpart return the real and imaginary parts of number respectively. If number is  real,  then realpart returns number and imagpart returns (* 0 number), which has the effect that the imaginary part of a rational is 0 and that of a float is a floating-point zero of the same format.

Examples:
 (realpart #c(23 41)) =>  23
 (imagpart #c(23 41.0)) =>  41.0
 (realpart #c(23 41.0)) =>  23.0
 (imagpart 23.0) =>  0.0

Exceptional Situations:
Should signal an error of type type-error if number is not a number.
