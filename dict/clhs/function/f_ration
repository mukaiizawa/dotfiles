Function RATIONAL, RATIONALIZE

Syntax:
rational number => rational
rationalize number => rational

Arguments and Values:
number---a real.
rational---a rational.

Description:
rational and rationalize convert  reals  to rationals.
If number is already rational, it is returned.
If number is a float, rational returns a rational that is mathematically equal in value to the float. rationalize returns a rational that approximates the float to the accuracy of the underlying floating-point representation.
rational assumes that the float is completely accurate.
rationalize assumes that the float is accurate only to the precision of the floating-point representation.

Examples:
 (rational 0) =>  0
 (rationalize -11/100) =>  -11/100
 (rational .1) =>  13421773/134217728 ;implementation-dependent
 (rationalize .1) =>  1/10

Affected By:
The implementation.

Exceptional Situations:
Should signal an error of type type-error if number is not a real. Might signal arithmetic-error.

Notes:
It is always the case that
 (float (rational x) x) ==  x
 and
 (float (rationalize x) x) ==  x
 That is, rationalizing a float by either method and then converting it back to a float of the same format produces the original number. The following X3J13 cleanup issue, not part of the specification, applies to this section: REAL-NUMBER-TYPE:X3J13-MAR-89
