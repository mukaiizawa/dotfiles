Accessor LDB

Syntax:
ldb bytespec integer => byte
(setf (ldb bytespec place) new-byte)

Arguments and Values:
bytespec---a byte specifier.
integer---an integer.
byte, new-byte---a non-negative integer.

Description:
ldb extracts and returns the byte of integer specified by bytespec.
ldb returns an integer in which the bits with weights 2^(s-1) through 2^0 are the same as those in integer with weights 2^(p+s-1) through 2^p, and all other bits zero; s is (byte-size bytespec) and p is (byte-position bytespec).
setf may be used with ldb to modify a byte within the integer that is stored in a given place.  The order of evaluation, when an ldb form is supplied to setf, is exactly left-to-right.  The effect is to perform a dpb operation and then store the result back into the place.

Examples:
 (ldb (byte 2 1) 10) =>  1
 (setq a (list 8)) =>  (8)
 (setf (ldb (byte 2 1) (car a)) 1) =>  1
 a =>  (10)

See Also:
byte, byte-position, byte-size, dpb

Notes:
 (logbitp j (ldb (byte s p) n))
    ==  (and (< j s) (logbitp (+ j p) n))
In general,
 (ldb (byte 0 x) y) =>  0
for all valid values of x and y.
Historically, the name ``ldb'' comes from a DEC PDP-10 assembly language instruction meaning ``load byte.''
