CLHS: Function LISTEN
Function LISTEN 
Syntax:
listen &optional input-stream => generalized-boolean
Arguments and Values:
input-stream---an input stream designator. The default is standard input. 
generalized-boolean---a generalized boolean. 
Description:
Returns true if there is a character immediately available from input-stream; otherwise, returns false. On a non-interactive input-stream, listen returns true except when at end of file[1]. If an end of file is encountered, listen returns false. listen is intended to be used when input-stream obtains characters from an interactive device such as a keyboard. 
Examples:
 (progn (unread-char (read-char)) (list (listen) (read-char)))
>>  1
=>  (T #1)
 (progn (clear-input) (listen))
=>  NIL ;Unless you're a very fast typist!
Side Effects: None.
