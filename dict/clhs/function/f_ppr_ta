CLHS: Function PPRINT-TAB
Function PPRINT-TAB 
Syntax:
pprint-tab kind colnum colinc &optional stream => nil
Arguments and Values:
kind---one of :line, :section, :line-relative, or :section-relative. 
colnum---a non-negative integer. 
colinc---a non-negative integer. 
stream---an output stream designator. 
Description:
Specifies tabbing to stream as performed by the standard ~T format directive.  If stream is a pretty printing stream and the value of *print-pretty* is true,  tabbing is performed; otherwise, pprint-tab has no effect. 
The arguments colnum and colinc correspond to the two parameters to ~T and are in terms of ems. The kind argument specifies the style of tabbing. It must be one of :line (tab as by ~T), :section (tab as by ~:T, but measuring horizontal positions relative to the start of the dynamically enclosing section), :line-relative (tab as by ~@T), or :section-relative (tab as by ~:@T, but measuring horizontal positions relative to the start of the dynamically enclosing section). 
Examples: None.
Side Effects: None.
Affected By: None.
Exceptional Situations:
An error is signaled if kind is not one of :line, :section, :line-relative, or :section-relative.
