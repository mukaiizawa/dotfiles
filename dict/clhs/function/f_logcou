Function LOGCOUNT

Syntax:
logcount integer => number-of-on-bits

Arguments and Values:
integer---an integer.
number-of-on-bits---a non-negative integer.

Description:
Computes and returns the number of bits in the two's-complement binary representation of integer that are `on' or `set'. If integer is negative, the 0 bits are counted; otherwise, the 1 bits are counted.

Examples:
 (logcount 0) =>  0
 (logcount -1) =>  0
 (logcount 7) =>  3
 (logcount  13) =>  3 ;Two's-complement binary: ...0001101
 (logcount -13) =>  2 ;Two's-complement binary: ...1110011
 (logcount  30) =>  4 ;Two's-complement binary: ...0011110
 (logcount -30) =>  4 ;Two's-complement binary: ...1100010
 (logcount (expt 2 100)) =>  1
 (logcount (- (expt 2 100))) =>  100
 (logcount (- (1+ (expt 2 100)))) =>  1

Exceptional Situations:
Should signal type-error if its argument is not an integer.

Notes:
Even if the implementation does not represent integers internally in two's complement binary, logcount behaves as if it did.
The following identity always holds:
    (logcount x)
 ==  (logcount (- (+ x 1)))
 ==  (logcount (lognot x))
