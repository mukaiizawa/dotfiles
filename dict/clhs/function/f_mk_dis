CLHS: Function MAKE-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER
Function MAKE-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER 
Syntax:
make-dispatch-macro-character char &optional non-terminating-p readtable => t
Arguments and Values:
 char---a character.  
non-terminating-p---a generalized boolean. The default is false. 
readtable---a readtable. The default is the current readtable. 
Description:
make-dispatch-macro-character makes char be a dispatching macro character in readtable. 
Initially, every character in the dispatch table associated with the char has an associated function that signals an error of type reader-error. 
If non-terminating-p is true, the dispatching macro character is made a non-terminating macro character; if non-terminating-p is false, the dispatching macro character is made a terminating macro character. 
Examples:
 (get-macro-character #{) =>  NIL, false
 (make-dispatch-macro-character #{) =>  T
 (not (get-macro-character #{)) =>  false
Side Effects: None.
