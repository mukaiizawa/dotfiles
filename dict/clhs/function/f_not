CLHS: Function NOT
Function NOT 
Syntax:
not x => boolean
Arguments and Values:
x---a generalized boolean (i.e., any object). 
boolean---a boolean. 
Description:
Returns t if x is false; otherwise, returns nil. 
Examples:
 (not nil) =>  T
 (not '()) =>  T
 (not (integerp 'sss)) =>  T
 (not (integerp 1)) =>  NIL
 (not 3.7) =>  NIL
 (not 'apple) =>  NIL
Side Effects: None.
Affected By: None.
Exceptional Situations: None.

null 
Notes:
not is intended to be used to invert the `truth value' of a boolean (or generalized boolean) whereas null is intended to be used to test for the empty list. Operationally, not and null compute the same result; which to use is a matter of style.
