Function MAKE-STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM 
Syntax:
make-string-output-stream &key element-type => string-stream
Arguments and Values:
 element-type---a type specifier. The default is character.

Examples:
 (let ((s (make-string-output-stream)))
   (write-string 'testing... ' s)
   (prin1 1234 s)
   (get-output-stream-string s))
=>  'testing... 1234'
