Function CHAR-INT

Syntax:
char-int character => integer

Arguments and Values:
character---a character.
integer---a non-negative integer.

Description:
Returns a non-negative integer encoding the character object. The manner in which the integer is computed is implementation-dependent. In contrast to sxhash, the result is not guaranteed to be independent of the particular Lisp image. 
If character has no implementation-defined attributes, the results of char-int and char-code are the same.
 (char= c1 c2) ==  (= (char-int c1) (char-int c2))
for characters c1 and c2.

Examples:
 (char-int #A) =>  65       ; implementation A
 (char-int #A) =>  577      ; implementation B
 (char-int #A) =>  262145   ; implementation C
