CLHS: Function HASH-TABLE-REHASH-SIZE
Function HASH-TABLE-REHASH-SIZE
Syntax:
hash-table-rehash-size hash-table => rehash-size
Arguments and Values:
hash-table---a hash table.
rehash-size---a real of type (or (integer 1 *) (float (1.0) *)).
Description:
Returns the current rehash size of hash-table, suitable for use in a call to make-hash-table in order to produce a hash table with state corresponding to the current state of the hash-table.
Examples:
 (setq table (make-hash-table :size 100 :rehash-size 1.4))
=>  #<HASH-TABLE EQL 0/100 2556371>
 (hash-table-rehash-size table) =>  1.4
Side Effects: None.
Affected By: None.
Exceptional Situations:
Should signal an error of type type-error if hash-table is not a hash table.
See Also:
make-hash-table, hash-table-rehash-threshold
Notes:
 If the hash table was created with an integer rehash size, the result is an integer, indicating that the rate of growth of the hash-table when rehashed is intended to be additive; otherwise, the result is a float, indicating that the rate of growth of the hash-table when rehashed is intended to be multiplicative. However, this value is only advice to the implementation; the actual amount by which the hash-table will grow upon rehash is implementation-dependent.
