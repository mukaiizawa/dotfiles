Function PATHNAME-MATCH-P

Syntax:
pathname-match-p pathname wildcard => generalized-boolean

Arguments and Values:
pathname---a pathname designator.
wildcard---a designator for a wild pathname.
generalized-boolean---a generalized boolean.

Description:
pathname-match-p returns true if pathname matches wildcard, otherwise nil. The matching rules are implementation-defined but should be consistent with directory. Missing components of wildcard default to :wild.
It is valid for pathname to be a wild pathname; a wildcard field in pathname only matches a wildcard field in wildcard (i.e., pathname-match-p is not commutative). It is valid for wildcard to be a non-wild pathname.

Exceptional Situations:
If pathname or wildcard is not a pathname, string, or stream associated with a file an error of type type-error is signaled.
