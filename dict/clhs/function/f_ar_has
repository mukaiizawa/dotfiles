CLHS: Function ARRAY-HAS-FILL-POINTER-P
Function ARRAY-HAS-FILL-POINTER-P
Syntax:
array-has-fill-pointer-p array => generalized-boolean
Arguments and Values:
array---an array.
generalized-boolean---a generalized boolean.
Description:
Returns true if array has a fill pointer; otherwise returns false.
Examples:
 (array-has-fill-pointer-p (make-array 4)) =>  implementation-dependent
 (array-has-fill-pointer-p (make-array '(2 3))) =>  false
 (array-has-fill-pointer-p
   (make-array 8
               :fill-pointer 2
               :initial-element 'filler)) =>  true
Affected By: None.
Exceptional Situations:
Should signal an error of type type-error if its argument is not an array.
See Also:
make-array, fill-pointer
Notes:
Since arrays of rank other than one cannot have a fill pointer, array-has-fill-pointer-p always returns nil when its argument is such an array.
