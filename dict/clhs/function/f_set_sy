CLHS: Function SET-SYNTAX-FROM-CHAR
Function SET-SYNTAX-FROM-CHAR 
Syntax:
set-syntax-from-char to-char from-char &optional to-readtable from-readtable => t
  
Arguments and Values:
 to-char---a character. 
from-char---a character.  
to-readtable---a readtable. The default is the current readtable. 
from-readtable---a readtable designator. The default is the standard readtable. 
Description:
set-syntax-from-char makes the syntax of to-char in to-readtable be the same as the syntax of from-char in from-readtable. 
set-syntax-from-char copies the syntax types of from-char. If from-char is a macro character, its reader macro function is copied also. If the character is a dispatching macro character, its entire dispatch table of reader macro functions is copied. The constituent traits of from-char are not copied. 
A macro definition from a character such as ' can be copied to another character; the standard definition for ' looks for another character that is the same as the character that invoked it. The definition of ( can not be meaningfully copied to {, on the other hand. The result is that lists are of the form {a b c), not {a b c}, because the definition always looks for a closing parenthesis, not a closing brace. 
Examples:
 (set-syntax-from-char #7 #;) =>  T
 123579 =>  1235
Side Effects:
The to-readtable is modified. 
Affected By:
The existing values in the from-readtable. 
Exceptional Situations: None.

Notes:
The constituent traits of a character are ``hard wired'' into the parser for extended tokens. For example, if the definition of S is copied to *, then * will become a constituent that is alphabetic[2] but that cannot be used as a short float exponent marker. For further information, see Section 2.1.4.2 (Constituent Traits).
