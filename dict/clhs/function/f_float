CLHS: Function FLOAT
Function FLOAT
Syntax:
float number &optional prototype => float
Arguments and Values:
number---a real.
prototype---a float.
float---a float.
Description:
float converts a  real  number to a float.
If a prototype is supplied, a float is returned that is mathematically equal to number but has the same format as prototype.
If prototype is not supplied, then if the number is already a float, it is returned; otherwise, a float is returned that is mathematically equal to number but is a single float.
Examples:
 (float 0) =>  0.0
 (float 1 .5) =>  1.0
 (float 1.0) =>  1.0
 (float 1/2) =>  0.5
=>  1.0d0
OR=>  1.0
 (eql (float 1.0 1.0d0) 1.0d0) =>  true
