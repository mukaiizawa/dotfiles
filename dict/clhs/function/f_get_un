CLHS: Function GET-UNIVERSAL-TIME, GET-DECODED-TIME
Function GET-UNIVERSAL-TIME, GET-DECODED-TIME
Syntax:
get-universal-time <no arguments> => universal-time
get-decoded-time <no arguments> => second, minute, hour, date, month, year, day, daylight-p, zone
Arguments and Values:
universal-time---a universal time.
second, minute, hour, date, month, year, day, daylight-p, zone---a decoded time.
Description:
get-universal-time returns the current time, represented as a universal time.
get-decoded-time returns the current time, represented as a decoded time.
Examples:
;; At noon on July 4, 1976 in Eastern Daylight Time.
 (get-decoded-time) =>  0, 0, 12, 4, 7, 1976, 6, true, 5
;; At exactly the same instant.
 (get-universal-time) =>  2414332800
;; Exactly five minutes later.
 (get-universal-time) =>  2414333100
;; The difference is 300 seconds (five minutes)
 (- * **) =>  300
Side Effects: None.
Affected By:
The time of day (i.e., the passage of time), the system clock's ability to keep accurate time, and the accuracy of the system clock's initial setting.
Exceptional Situations:
An error of type error might be signaled if the current time cannot be determined.

Notes:
 (get-decoded-time) ==  (decode-universal-time (get-universal-time))
No implementation is required to have a way to verify that the time returned is correct. However, if an implementation provides a validity check (e.g., the failure to have properly initialized the system clock can be reliably detected) and that validity check fails, the implementation is strongly encouraged (but not required) to signal an error of type error (rather than, for example, returning a known-to-be-wrong value) that is correctable by allowing the user to interactively set the correct time.
