Function NTHCDR

Syntax:
nthcdr n list => tail

Arguments and Values:
 n---a non-negative integer.
list---a list,  which might be a dotted list or a circular list.
tail---an object.

Description:
Returns the tail of list that would be obtained by calling cdr n times in succession.

Examples:
 (nthcdr 0 '()) =>  NIL
 (nthcdr 3 '()) =>  NIL
 (nthcdr 0 '(a b c)) =>  (A B C)
 (nthcdr 2 '(a b c)) =>  (C)
 (nthcdr 4 '(a b c)) =>  ()
 (nthcdr 1 '(0 . 1)) =>  1
 (locally (declare (optimize (safety 3)))
   (nthcdr 3 '(0 . 1)))
Error: Attempted to take CDR of 1.

Exceptional Situations:
Should signal an error of type type-error if n is not a non-negative integer.
For n being an integer greater than 1, the error checking done by (nthcdr n list) is the same as for (nthcdr (- n 1) (cdr list)); see the function cdr.
