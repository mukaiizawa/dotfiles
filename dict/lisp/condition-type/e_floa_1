Condition Type FLOATING-POINT-INEXACT

Class Precedence List:
floating-point-inexact, arithmetic-error, error, serious-condition, condition, t

Description:
The type floating-point-inexact consists of error conditions that occur because of certain floating point traps.
It is implementation-dependent whether floating point traps occur, and whether or how they may be enabled or disabled. Therefore, conforming code may establish handlers for this condition, but must not depend on its being signaled.
