Function DISASSEMBLE

Syntax:
disassemble fn => nil

Arguments and Values:
fn---an extended function designator or a lambda expression.

Description:
The function disassemble is a debugging aid that composes symbolic instructions or expressions in some implementation-dependent language which represent the code used to produce the function which is or is named by the argument fn. The result is displayed to standard output in an implementation-dependent format.
If fn is a lambda expression or interpreted function, it is compiled first and the result is disassembled.
If the fn designator is a function name, the function that it names is disassembled.  (If that function is an interpreted function, it is first compiled but the result of this implicit compilation is not installed.)

Examples:
 (defun f (a) (1+ a)) =>  F
 (eq (symbol-function 'f)
     (progn (disassemble 'f)
            (symbol-function 'f))) =>  true

Affected By:
*standard-output*.

Exceptional Situations:
Should signal an error of type type-error if fn is not an extended function designator or a lambda expression.
