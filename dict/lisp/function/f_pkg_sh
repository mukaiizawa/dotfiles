Syntax:
package-shadowing-symbols package => symbols

Arguments and Values:
package---a package designator.
symbols---a list of symbols.

Description:
Returns a list of symbols that have been declared as shadowing symbols in package by shadow or shadowing-import (or the equivalent defpackage options). All symbols on this list are present in package.

Examples:
 (package-shadowing-symbols (make-package 'temp)) =>  ()
 (shadow 'cdr 'temp) =>  T
 (package-shadowing-symbols 'temp) =>  (TEMP::CDR)
 (intern 'PILL' 'temp) =>  TEMP::PILL, NIL

 (package-shadowing-symbols 'temp) =>  (PILL TEMP::CDR)

Exceptional Situations:
Should signal an error of type type-error if package is not a package designator.

shadow, shadowing-import

Notes:
Whether the list of symbols is fresh is implementation-dependent.
