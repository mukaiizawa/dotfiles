Function SLOT-MAKUNBOUND

Syntax:
slot-makunbound instance slot-name => instance

Arguments and Values:
instance -- instance.
Slot-name---a symbol.

Description:
The function slot-makunbound restores a slot of the name slot-name in an instance to the unbound state.

Exceptional Situations:
If no slot of the name slot-name exists in the instance, slot-missing is called as follows:
(slot-missing (class-of instance)
              instance
              slot-name
              'slot-makunbound)
 (Any values returned by slot-missing in this case are ignored by slot-makunbound.)
 The specific behavior depends on instance's metaclass. An error is never signaled if instance has metaclass standard-class. An error is always signaled if instance has metaclass built-in-class. The consequences are undefined if instance has any other metaclass--an error might or might not be signaled in this situation. Note in particular that the behavior for conditions and structures is not specified.

Notes:
Although no implementation is required to do so, implementors are strongly encouraged to implement the function slot-makunbound using the function slot-makunbound-using-class described in the Metaobject Protocol.
