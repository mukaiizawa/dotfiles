Function METHOD-COMBINATION-ERROR

Syntax:
method-combination-error format-control &rest args => implementation-dependent

Arguments and Values:
format-control---a format control.
args---format arguments for format-control.

Description:
The function method-combination-error is used to signal an error in method combination.
The error message is constructed by using a format-control suitable for format and any args to it. Because an implementation may need to add additional contextual information to the error message, method-combination-error should be called only within the dynamic extent of a method combination function.
Whether method-combination-error returns to its caller or exits via throw is implementation-dependent.

Side Effects:
The debugger might be entered.
