Function /

Syntax:
/ number => reciprocal
/ numerator &rest denominators+ => quotient

Arguments and Values:
number, denominator---a non-zero number.
numerator, quotient, reciprocal---a number.

Description:
The function / performs division or reciprocation.
If no denominators are supplied, the function / returns the reciprocal of number.
If at least one denominator is supplied, the function / divides the numerator by all of the denominators and returns the resulting quotient.
If each argument is either an integer or a ratio, and the result is not an integer, then it is a ratio.
The function / performs necessary type conversions.
If any argument is a float then the rules of floating-point contagion apply; see Section 12.1.4 (Floating-point Computations).

Examples:
 (/ 12 4) =>  3
 (/ 13 4) =>  13/4
 (/ -8) =>  -1/8
 (/ 3 4 5) =>  3/20
 (/ 0.5) =>  2.0
 (/ 20 5) =>  4
 (/ 5 20) =>  1/4
 (/ 60 -2 3 5.0) =>  -2.0
 (/ 2 #c(2 2)) =>  #C(1/2 -1/2)

Exceptional Situations:
The consequences are unspecified if any argument other than the first is zero. If there is only one argument, the consequences are unspecified if it is zero.
Might signal type-error if some argument is not a number. Might signal division-by-zero if division by zero is attempted. Might signal arithmetic-error.
