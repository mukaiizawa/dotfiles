Function COPY-SEQ

Syntax:
copy-seq sequence => copied-sequence

Arguments and Values:
sequence---a proper sequence.
copied-sequence---a proper sequence.

Description:
Creates a copy of sequence. The elements of the new sequence are the same as the corresponding elements of the given sequence.
If sequence is a vector, the result is a fresh simple array of rank one that has the same actual array element type as sequence. If sequence is a list, the result is a fresh list.

Examples:
 (setq str 'a string') =>  'a string'
 (equalp str (copy-seq str)) =>  true
 (eql str (copy-seq str)) =>  false

Exceptional Situations:
Should be prepared to signal an error of type type-error if sequence is not a proper sequence.

copy-list

Notes:
From a functional standpoint,
 (copy-seq x) ==  (subseq x 0)
However, the programmer intent is typically very different in these two cases.
