Function PHASE

Syntax:
phase number => phase

Arguments and Values:
number---a number.
phase---a number.

Description:
phase returns the phase of number (the angle part of its polar representation) in radians, in the range  -<PI> (exclusive) if minus zero is not supported, or -<PI> (inclusive) if minus zero is supported,  to <PI> (inclusive). The phase of a positive  real  number is zero; that of a negative  real  number is <PI>. The phase of zero is defined to be zero.
If number is a complex float, the result is a float of the same type as the components of number. If number is a float, the result is a float of the same type. If number is a rational or a complex rational, the result is a single float.
The branch cut for phase lies along the negative real axis, continuous with quadrant II. The range consists of that portion of the real axis between -<PI> (exclusive) and <PI> (inclusive).
The mathematical definition of phase is as follows:
(phase x) = (atan (imagpart x) (realpart x))

Examples:
 (phase 1) =>  0.0s0
 (phase 0) =>  0.0s0
 (phase (cis 30)) =>  -1.4159266
 (phase #c(0 1)) =>  1.5707964

Exceptional Situations:
Should signal type-error if its argument is not a number. Might signal arithmetic-error.
