Function PROBE-FILE

Syntax:
probe-file pathspec => truename

Arguments and Values:
pathspec---a pathname designator.
truename---a physical pathname or nil.

Description:
probe-file tests whether a file exists.
probe-file returns false if there is no file named pathspec, and otherwise returns the truename of pathspec.
If the pathspec designator is an open stream, then probe-file produces the truename of its associated file.  If pathspec is a stream, whether open or closed, it is coerced to a pathname as if by the function pathname.

Affected By:
The host computer's file system.

Exceptional Situations:
An error of type file-error is signaled if pathspec is wild.
An error of type file-error is signaled if the file system cannot perform the requested operation.
