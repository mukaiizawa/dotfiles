Function READ-BYTE

Syntax:
read-byte stream &optional eof-error-p eof-value => byte

Arguments and Values:
stream---a binary input stream.
eof-error-p---a generalized boolean. The default is true.
eof-value---an object. The default is nil.
byte---an integer, or the eof-value.

Description:
read-byte reads and returns one byte from stream.
If an end of file[2] occurs and eof-error-p is false, the eof-value is returned.

Examples:
 (with-open-file (s 'temp-bytes'
                     :direction :output
                     :element-type 'unsigned-byte)
    (write-byte 101 s)) =>  101
 (with-open-file (s 'temp-bytes' :element-type 'unsigned-byte)
    (format t '~S ~S' (read-byte s) (read-byte s nil 'eof)))
>>  101 EOF
=>  NIL

Side Effects:
Modifies stream.

Exceptional Situations:
Should signal an error of type type-error if stream is not a stream.
Should signal an error of type error if stream is not a binary input stream.
If there are no bytes remaining in the stream and eof-error-p is true, an error of type end-of-file is signaled.
