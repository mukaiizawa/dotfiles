Function VECTOR-POP

Syntax:
vector-pop vector => element

Arguments and Values:
vector---a vector with a fill pointer.
element---an object.

Description:
Decreases the fill pointer of vector by one, and retrieves the element of vector that is designated by the new fill pointer.

Examples:
 (vector-push (setq fable (list 'fable))
              (setq fa (make-array 8
                                   :fill-pointer 2
                                   :initial-element 'sisyphus))) =>  2
 (fill-pointer fa) =>  3
 (eq (vector-pop fa) fable) =>  true
 (vector-pop fa) =>  SISYPHUS
 (fill-pointer fa) =>  1

Side Effects:
The fill pointer is decreased by one.

Affected By:
The value of the fill pointer.

Exceptional Situations:
An error of type type-error is signaled if vector does not have a fill pointer.
If the fill pointer is zero, vector-pop signals an error of type error.
