Function LOGICAL-PATHNAME

Syntax:
logical-pathname pathspec => logical-pathname

Arguments and Values:
pathspec---a logical pathname, a logical pathname namestring, or a stream.
logical-pathname---a logical pathname.

Description:
logical-pathname converts pathspec to a logical pathname and returns the new logical pathname. If pathspec is a logical pathname namestring, it should contain a host component and its following colon. If pathspec is a stream, it should be one for which pathname returns a logical pathname.
If pathspec is a stream, the stream can be either open or closed. logical-pathname returns the same logical pathname after a file is closed as it did when the file was open.   It is an error if pathspec is a stream that is created with make-two-way-stream, make-echo-stream, make-broadcast-stream, make-concatenated-stream, make-string-input-stream, or make-string-output-stream.

Exceptional Situations:
Signals an error of type type-error if pathspec isn't supplied correctly.
