Accessor REST

Syntax:
rest list => tail
(setf (rest list) new-tail)

Arguments and Values:
list---a list,  which might be a dotted list or a circular list.
tail---an object.

Description:
rest performs the same operation as cdr, but mnemonically complements first. Specifically,
 (rest list) ==  (cdr list)
 (setf (rest list) new-tail) ==  (setf (cdr list) new-tail)

Examples:
 (rest '(1 2)) =>  (2)
 (rest '(1 . 2)) =>  2
 (rest '(1)) =>  NIL
 (setq *cons* '(1 . 2)) =>  (1 . 2)
 (setf (rest *cons*) 'two') =>  'two'
 *cons* =>  (1 . 'two')

See Also:
cdr, nthcdr

Notes:
rest is often preferred stylistically over cdr when the argument is to being subjectively viewed as a list rather than as a cons.
