Function DRIBBLE

Syntax:
dribble &optional pathname => implementation-dependent

Arguments and Values:
pathname---a pathname designator.

Description:
Either binds *standard-input* and *standard-output* or takes other appropriate action, so as to send a record of the input/output interaction to a file named by pathname. dribble is intended to create a readable record of an interactive session.
 If pathname is a logical pathname, it is translated into a physical pathname as if by calling translate-logical-pathname.
(dribble) terminates the recording of input and output and closes the dribble file.
 If dribble is called while a stream to a ``dribble file'' is still open from a previous call to dribble, the effect is implementation-defined. For example, the already-open stream might be closed, or dribbling might occur both to the old stream and to a new one, or the old stream might stay open but not receive any further output, or the new request might be ignored, or some other action might be taken.

Affected By:
The implementation.

Exceptional Situations:
If a failure occurs when performing some operation on the file system while creating the dribble file, an error of type file-error is signaled.
An error of type file-error might be signaled if pathname is a designator for a wild pathname.

Notes:
dribble can return before subsequent forms are executed. It also can enter a recursive interaction loop, returning only when (dribble) is done.
dribble is intended primarily for interactive debugging; its effect cannot be relied upon when used in a program.
