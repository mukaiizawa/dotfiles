Constant Variable SHORT-FLOAT-EPSILON, SHORT-FLOAT-NEGATIVE-EPSILON, SINGLE-FLOAT-EPSILON, SINGLE-FLOAT-NEGATIVE-EPSILON, DOUBLE-FLOAT-EPSILON, DOUBLE-FLOAT-NEGATIVE-EPSILON, LONG-FLOAT-EPSILON, LONG-FLOAT-NEGATIVE-EPSILON

Constant Value:
implementation-dependent.

Description:
The value of each of the constants short-float-epsilon, single-float-epsilon, double-float-epsilon, and long-float-epsilon is the smallest positive float <EPSILON> of the given format, such that the following expression is true when evaluated:
(not (= (float 1 <EPSILON>) (+ (float 1 <EPSILON>) <EPSILON>)))
The value of each of the constants short-float-negative-epsilon, single-float-negative-epsilon, double-float-negative-epsilon, and long-float-negative-epsilon is the smallest positive float <EPSILON> of the given format, such that the following expression is true when evaluated:
(not (= (float 1 <EPSILON>) (- (float 1 <EPSILON>) <EPSILON>)))
