Variable *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS*

Value Type:
a pathname object.

Initial Value:
An implementation-dependent pathname, typically in the working directory that was current when Common Lisp was started up.

Description:
a pathname, used as the default whenever a function needs a default pathname and one is not supplied.

Examples:
 ;; This example illustrates a possible usage for a hypothetical Lisp running on a
 ;; DEC TOPS-20 file system.  Since pathname conventions vary between Lisp
 ;; implementations and host file system types, it is not possible to provide a
 ;; general-purpose, conforming example.
 *default-pathname-defaults* =>  #P'PS:<FRED>'
 (merge-pathnames (make-pathname :name 'CALENDAR'))
=>  #P'PS:<FRED>CALENDAR'
 (let ((*default-pathname-defaults* (pathname '<MARY>')))
   (merge-pathnames (make-pathname :name 'CALENDAR')))
=>  #P'<MARY>CALENDAR'

Affected By:
The implementation.
