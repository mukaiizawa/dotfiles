Constant Variable BOOLE-1, BOOLE-2, BOOLE-AND, BOOLE-ANDC1, BOOLE-ANDC2, BOOLE-C1, BOOLE-C2, BOOLE-CLR, BOOLE-EQV, BOOLE-IOR, BOOLE-NAND, BOOLE-NOR, BOOLE-ORC1, BOOLE-ORC2, BOOLE-SET, BOOLE-XOR

Constant Value:
The identity and nature of the values of each of these variables is implementation-dependent, except that it must be distinct from each of the values of the others, and it must be a valid first argument to the function boole.

Description:
Each of these constants has a value which is one of the sixteen possible bit-wise logical operation specifiers.

Examples:
 (boole boole-ior 1 16) =>  17
 (boole boole-and -2 5) =>  4
 (boole boole-eqv 17 15) =>  -31
