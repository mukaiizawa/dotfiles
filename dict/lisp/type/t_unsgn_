Type UNSIGNED-BYTE

Supertypes:
unsigned-byte, signed-byte, integer, rational,  real,  number, t

Description:
The atomic type specifier unsigned-byte denotes the same type as is denoted by the type specifier (integer 0 *).

Compound Type Specifier Kind:
Abbreviating.

Compound Type Specifier Syntax:
unsigned-byte [s | *]

Compound Type Specifier Arguments:
s---a positive integer.

Compound Type Specifier Description:
This denotes the set of non-negative integers that can be represented in a byte of size s (bits). This is equivalent to (mod m) for m=2^s, or to (integer 0 n) for n=2^s-1. The type unsigned-byte or the type (unsigned-byte *) is the same as the type (integer 0 *), the set of non-negative integers.

Notes:
The type (unsigned-byte 1) is also called bit.
