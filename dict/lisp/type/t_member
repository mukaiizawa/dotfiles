Compound Type Specifier Description:
This denotes the set containing the named objects. An object is of this type if and only if it is eql to one of the specified objects.
The type specifiers (member) and nil are equivalent. * can be among the objects, but if so it denotes itself (the symbol *) and does not represent an unspecified value. The symbol member is not valid as a type specifier; and, specifically, it is not an abbreviation for either (member) or (member *).
