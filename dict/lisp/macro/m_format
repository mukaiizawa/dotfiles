Macro FORMATTER

Syntax:
formatter control-string => function

Arguments and Values:
control-string---a format string; not evaluated.
function---a function.

Description:
Returns a function which has behavior equivalent to:
  #'(lambda (*standard-output* &rest arguments)
      (apply #'format t control-string arguments)
      arguments-tail)
where arguments-tail is either the tail of arguments which has as its car the argument that would be processed next if there were more format directives in the control-string, or else nil if no more arguments follow the most recently processed argument.

Examples:
(funcall (formatter '~&~A~A') *standard-output* 'a 'b 'c)
>>  AB
=>  (C)
(format t (formatter '~&~A~A') 'a 'b 'c)
>>  AB
=>  NIL

Exceptional Situations:
Might signal an error (at macro expansion time or at run time) if the argument is not a valid format string.
