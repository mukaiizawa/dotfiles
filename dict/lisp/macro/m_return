Macro RETURN

Syntax:
return [result] =>|

Arguments and Values:
result---a form; evaluated. The default is nil.

Description:
Returns, as if by return-from, from the block named nil.

Examples:
 (block nil (return) 1) =>  NIL
 (block nil (return 1) 2) =>  1
 (block nil (return (values 1 2)) 3) =>  1, 2
 (block nil (block alpha (return 1) 2)) =>  1
 (block alpha (block nil (return 1)) 2) =>  2
 (block nil (block nil (return 1) 2)) =>  1

See Also:
block, return-from

Notes:
 (return) ==  (return-from nil)
 (return form) ==  (return-from nil form)
The implicit blocks established by macros such as do are often named nil, so that return can be used to exit from such forms.
